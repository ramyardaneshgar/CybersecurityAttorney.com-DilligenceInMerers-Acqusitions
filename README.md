## Introduction

Cybersecurity due diligence is a critical component of the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) process, particularly as data breaches, regulatory risks, and system vulnerabilities can materially affect the value of a target company. Acquirers must evaluate the cybersecurity posture of a target to avoid inheriting hidden liabilities or compliance failures that may result in future fines, litigation, or reputational damage. In this guide, I outline how cybersecurity assessments are performed across five phases—each targeting specific areas of operational, technical, legal, and human risk.

## Phase 1: Pre-Deal Cybersecurity Risk Scoping

Acquirers begin by identifying critical assets such as:
- **Structured and unstructured data repositories** (databases, CRM systems, file shares)
- **Business-critical applications and APIs**
- **Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP)** and associated IAM roles
- **IoT or industrial control systems (ICS)** for manufacturing firms

The threat model is customized by sector. For example:
- A **fintech firm** must consider PCI-DSS, banking trojans, and SIM-swapping attacks.
- A **healthtech company** must plan for HIPAA, ransomware targeting PHI, and insider misuse.

Open-source intelligence gathering involves:
- Reviewing **HaveIBeenPwned** and leaked credential dumps
- Checking Shodan/Censys for exposed services
- Reviewing VirusTotal for historical malware associations to domains/IPs
- Monitoring dark web mentions for data trade

## Phase 2: Technical and Infrastructure Evaluation

### Vulnerability Management
- Review automated scans for known CVEs using tools like Tenable, Qualys
- Inspect vulnerability aging reports (e.g., 60+ day unpatched high-severity CVEs)
- Identify weak protocols in use (e.g., SMBv1, Telnet)

### IAM Security
- Verify presence of **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** solutions (e.g., CyberArk)
- Audit **Azure AD and on-prem AD** group memberships
- Ensure MFA is enforced on **VPN, admin panels, and cloud consoles**

### Network Controls
- Assess presence and configuration of **NGFWs and segmentation policies**
- Examine internal VLAN isolation between user workstations and production servers
- Identify exposed RDP, SSH, or remote access tools like TeamViewer

### Incident Response Maturity
- Review the documented **IR playbook and runbooks**
- Confirm last date of **tabletop simulation or red team engagement**
- Examine integration with EDR/XDR tools (e.g., SentinelOne, CrowdStrike)

### Logging & SIEM
- Confirm central log ingestion using tools like **Splunk, ELK, or Chronicle**
- Check log retention duration and coverage (auth logs, DNS logs, firewall events)
- Ensure logs are **immutable** and follow chain-of-custody principles

## Phase 3: Legal and Regulatory Compliance

### Regulatory Alignment
- Map data processing activities to applicable frameworks:
  - **GDPR Articles 5–32** for processing, storage, breach notification
  - **CCPA/CPRA** for consumer opt-outs and data sharing disclosure
  - **SOX compliance** for public companies' internal control assertions

### Historical Legal Issues
- Review past **breach disclosures** under SEC or state law
- Investigate any **settlements with regulatory bodies** (e.g., FTC, HHS OCR)
- Examine pending litigation related to **cybersecurity negligence or privacy class actions**

### Contractual Commitments
- Review **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)** for breach notification timelines (e.g., 24 vs. 72 hours)
- Scrutinize **SaaS vendor agreements** for sub-processor clauses
- Check indemnification for data loss, ransomware, or APT compromise

---

## Phase 4: Human Risk and Security Culture

### Training & Awareness
- Request completion rates for **mandatory security awareness training**
- Review logs from **phishing simulation platforms** (e.g., KnowBe4)
- Verify use of **developer secure coding modules** (e.g., SecureFlag, AppSecEngineer)

### Insider Threat Controls
- Monitor for:
  - High-volume downloads from OneDrive/Dropbox
  - Unusual logins from new geographies or devices
- Ensure **device control** prevents unauthorized USB device usage
- Review DLP policies on sensitive IP (source code, contracts, PII)

### Employee Lifecycle Hygiene
- Confirm deprovisioning times for access revocation (<24 hours from termination)
- Require offboarding checklist tied to HRIS platforms (e.g., Workday)
- Audit ghost accounts or stale admin access

---

## Phase 5: Post-Acquisition Security Integration Plan

### Remediation Prioritization
- Use **risk heatmaps** to rank issues by exploitability and impact
- Develop 30/60/90-day remediation plans with budget alignment
- Use CIS Controls or NIST CSF as benchmarks for target state security

### Tool Consolidation
- Plan for:
  - Unifying SIEM platforms (e.g., migrating Splunk to Microsoft Sentinel)
  - Rationalizing endpoint protection (e.g., EDR overlap)
  - Standardizing email security and DNS filtering (e.g., Proofpoint, Cisco Umbrella)

### Strategic Risk Management
- Transfer high-risk items to **cyber insurance** with breach, BI, and regulatory liability riders
- Engage legal counsel to establish **cyber risk escrows or indemnity caps** in deal terms
- Apply **risk acceptance frameworks** like FAIR for unremediated legacy risks

---

## Red Flags That Should Delay or Kill a Deal

- **No endpoint protection or unsupported antivirus (e.g., AVG Free)**
- **Unencrypted sensitive databases or S3 buckets**
- **Credentials stored in plaintext configuration files or Git repos**
- **Ransomware event within the past 12 months with no disclosure**
- **Absence of vendor risk management for third-party SaaS integrations**
